# RefLink[Replace,paclet:ref/Replace] by default applies rules only to complete expressions:
ok  Replace[x^2, x^2 -> a + b]    ==>     a + b
    ---
    data:
        got: a + b
        expect: a + b
        expect_evaluated: a + b
    ...
# It does not map down to subparts:
ok  Replace[1 + x^2, x^2 -> a + b]    ==>     1 + x^2
    ---
    data:
        got: 1 + x^2
        expect: 1 + x^2
        expect_evaluated: 1 + x^2
    ...
# A list of rules gives a list of results:
ok  Replace[x, {{x -> a}, {x -> b}}]    ==>     {a, b}
    ---
    data:
        got: {a, b}
        expect: {a, b}
        expect_evaluated: {a, b}
    ...
# Replace at level 1:
ok  Replace[1 + x^2, x^2 -> a + b, {1}]    ==>     1 + a + b
    ---
    data:
        got: 1 + a + b
        expect: 1 + a + b
        expect_evaluated: 1 + a + b
    ...
# RefLink[Replace,paclet:ref/Replace] also works with RefLink[RuleDelayed,paclet:ref/RuleDelayed]:
ok  Replace[{x, x, x}, x :> RandomReal[], {1}]    ==>     {0.921434, 0.760332, 0.860225} # skip
